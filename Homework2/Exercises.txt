Create a program that manages the score of participants from a contest.
The score is between 1 and 10, and each participant has an identification number.

The program should contain a list of the participants and their scores with the following actions: 

1. Add a new partipant with score to the end of the list.
2. Add a new partipant with score to a position given in the list.
3. Delete a participant from a given position.
4. Modify the score of a participant by identification number.
5. Print all participants that have a score less that a given score.
6. Print all the participants in ascending order by score.
7. Print all the participants with a score bigger than a given score in ascending order by score.
8. Calculate the arithmetic mean of the scores for a given interval
( for example - the function receives 2 and 6, calculate the arithmetic mean of scores for participants from the list with the positions 2,3,4,5 and 6).
